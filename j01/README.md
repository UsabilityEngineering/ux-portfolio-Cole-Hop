I have an alarm clock that I find horrible to operate, and incredibly confusing. Not only are the buttons to configure the clock somewhat vague, but the fact that the buttons circle the entire perimeter of the clock makes it a task to find what you're looking for. I have owned this clock for about a year, and still have no idea what the buttons do. Since each button has roughly the same shape and size, and each has an icon that is informative. Along with this, some buttons have multiple uses if clicked after other buttons, making a clock that is not **learnable** nor **memorable** unless you have meticulously studied the instruction pamphlet.

Because the buttons are circling the clock, it is impossible to see all buttons at once. This makes it basically a chore to locate the button you want to use to complete a task. Sometimes I find myself looking at it for a couple of minutes until I can identify which button I should press, which makes this a very **inefficient** clock to use if time is of importance. Most of the issues come with trying to change the alarm time or change the time on the clock. You have to press multiple buttons in a specific order to be able to alter clock time, and altering the hours and minutes is its own struggle. Although, there was one button which has good **mapping**, that being the largest button on the very top being the snooze button. I had no problem finding this since every alarm clock I’ve come across always has this same design. All other buttons did not have **natural mapping**, making it still a struggle for me to **memorize** their functions

Although I struggle with the button layout and icon designs, other aspects of this clock are **effective**, that being the alarm system. The entire face of the clock basically acts as a lightbulb, naturally waking you up from sleep. The alarm tones are also very **efficient**, and I’ve never slept through the first 5 seconds of it being activated, so it has served its purpose. It is fairly **error-tolerant** as well, as I have never had any issues in it and the clock is fairly simple so it would be hard to create errors unless a button had broke or the LED's died. Overall, I think this alarm clock serves its purpose and is **effective** in the task in which it was created, but **inefficient** in the user's ability to **learn** how to operate it and **memorize** all the functionality it provides.
